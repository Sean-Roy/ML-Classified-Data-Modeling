# ML-Classified-Data-Modeling
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) machine learning and data analysis/exploration of some classified data.

KNN is utilized to predict the probability that a given entry has a specific classified target class.

Building on top of the basic KNN model, elbow method is performed in order to further improve the accuracy of the predictions.

As the values in the dataset are classified, what they represent is unknown.
